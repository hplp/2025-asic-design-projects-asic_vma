## Project Title:
ASIC VMA

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

## Key Objectives:
To evaluate and list out how Large Language Models, LLMs, such as ChatGPT can assist in various phases of ASIC digital design. Specifically, the project investigates prompting strategies for:

- RTL generation
- Design scaling
- Algorithm-to-HDL conversion
- Module integration
- Testbench generation and verification
- Timing constraint (SDC) file generation

And, to explore how these prompting techniques impact workflow efficiency, correctness, and synthesis performance within industry-standard toolchains like Synopsys Design Compiler and VCS. The effectiveness of each strategy will be evaluated based on:

- Functional correctness
- Synthesis performance (area, timing, power)
- Workflow automation and manual intervention required



## Technology Stack:
- Synopsys Design Compiler, VCS, Primtime
- ChatGPT / Claude
- Linux server
- Verilog Simulation/Testbench setup
- Python, Verilog, SV, TCL

## Expected Outcomes:
- Comparison of 4+ LLM prompting techniques on one hardware module, VMA
- Synthesis and timing reports via Design Compiler & Primetime
- A metrics based evaluation table (correctness, quality, automation)
- Analysis of LLM-generated constraint files (SDC)
- A report summarizing best practices and limitations of using LLMs for ASIC
